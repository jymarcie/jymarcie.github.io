Ram pressure stripping (RPS) is one of the most common mechanisms by which galaxies quench their star formation activity in galaxy clusters, due to the continuous loss of gas to the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). The close proximity of the Virgo cluster (~16 Mpc) has provided astronomers with spatially-resolved distributions of neutral (HI) and ionized (Halpha) hydrogen, for which a trend of decreasing gas content has been observed with decreasing projected clustercentric distances. We use a new approach of combining HI-to-stellar mass ratios and location in projected phase space to classify galaxies into different stages of RPS. With this methodology, we confirm that galaxies quench as they continuously lose their gas (decreasing HI-to-stellar mass ratios) and fall further into the cluster center (decreasing offsets in both clustercentric velocities and distances). The greatest advantage of this method lies in its applicability to galaxy clusters at higher redshifts, where obtaining spatially resolved distributions of HI is not as feasible.
