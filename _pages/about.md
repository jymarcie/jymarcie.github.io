"Where are you from?" is a question I have always had trouble answering, as a simple and short answer does not fully encapsulate who I am. Born in London and raised in Hong Kong as a Korean national, I grew up as a third culture kid, trying to assimilate myself in a broad range of cultures - Korean, Western, and Hong Kong. My ventures into astronomy had simple beginnings with an admiration of the HST images of the solar system, nebulae, and galaxies - one of my favorite pastimes was to sit in my room, reading through multiple astronomy books. You could even say that my determination to gain a more in-depth understanding of these majestic structures led me on a journey around the globe, starting with an undergraduate program in astrophysics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I then had the opportunity to spend some time in Korea, where I not only improved my Korean and gained a better understanding of Korean culture, but also delved deeper as a researcher in a master's program in astronomy at Seoul National University (SNU), where I had the privilege of working with **Prof. Myung Gyoon Lee** and [**A/Prof. Ho Seong Hwang**](https://hwanghs.github.io/). I have now found myself as a PhD candidate in Australia, at the Australian National University (ANU). Studying astronomy has not only made me feel humble about my existence within the immeasurable volume of the universe, but also helped me broaden my perspectives by introducing me to a diverse pool of inspiring individuals with passion and persistence. While I can't deny the growing pains of becoming a mature and independent researcher, I am looking forward to what awaits me next!

Aside from spending my day-to-day in astronomy, you can find me running and lifting weights at the gym, figuring out how to solve problems at the bouldering gym, or admiring nature by going on hikes. I also am always keen on finding new cafes that serve delicious coffee - I am currently (arguably) in one of the best countries to do so :)
