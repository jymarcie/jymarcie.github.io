I obtained my master's degree in astronomy at Seoul National University (SNU), where I had the privilege of working with **Prof. Myung Gyoon Lee** and [**A/Prof. Ho Seong Hwang**](https://hwanghs.github.io/). Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in astrophysics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
