Hi, my name is Marcie (Jae Yeon) Mun, and I am a PhD student at the Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics (RSAA) at the Australian National University (ANU). I am working with [**A/Prof. Emily Wisnioski**](https://wisnioski.github.io/) and in close collaboration with [**Dr. Andrew Battisti**](https://sites.google.com/view/ajbattisti/home), **Dr. Trevor Mendel**, and [**Prof. Sara Ellison**](https://www.astro.uvic.ca/~sara/).

I am broadly interested in nearly all areas of galaxy evolution, with a current focus on star formation activity at both local and global scales. I aim to use a combination of observations and simulations to connect the local and high-redshift universes to understand how galaxies have fueled, regulated and quenched their star formation activity across cosmic time.
