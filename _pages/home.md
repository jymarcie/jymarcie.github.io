Hi, my name is Marcie (Jae Yeon) Mun, and I am a PhD student at the Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics (RSAA) at the Australian National University (ANU). I am working with A/Prof. Emily Wisnioski and in close collaboration with Dr. Andrew Battisti, Dr. Trevor Mendel, and Prof. Sara Ellison.

I am broadly interested in nearly all areas of galaxy evolution, with a current focus on star formation activity at both local and global scales. I aim to use a combination of observations and simulations to connect the local and high-redshift universes to understand how galaxies have fueld, regulated and quenched their star formation activity across cosmic time.
