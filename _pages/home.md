Hi, my name is Marcie (Jae Yeon) Mun, and I am a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at the [Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (IAP)](https://www.iap.fr/?langue=en). I plan to study high-redshift galaxies with JWST at cosmic reionisation and cosmic dawn, working under the supervision of **Dr. Hakim Atek**. Previously, I was a PhD student at the [Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics (RSAA)](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/) at the Australian National University (ANU), where I was supervised by [**A/Prof. Emily Wisnioski**](https://wisnioski.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in nearly all areas of galaxy evolution, with a current focus on star formation activity at both local and global scales. I aim to use a combination of observations and simulations to connect the local and high-redshift universes to understand how galaxies have fueled, regulated and quenched their star formation activity across cosmic time.
